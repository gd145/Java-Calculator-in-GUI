# Dates

**Sprint Dates**: _e.g. 24th Nov - 7th Dec_


# Application Description

_provide a brief (< 100 words) explanation of the project. You are not directly graded on this, this is to help you clarify your own thinking and to help the marker understand the user stories. (delete this message once you've done this)_


# Team Definition of Done

_Your definition of done must contain 4-5 things that your team feel are important criteria to signal that a story in your project is "Done". The first two items of the definition of done must be as shown below. (delete this message once you've done this)_

# Sprint Retrospective 

## Sprint Retrospective Outcome

_After the first development sprint discuss and agree in a short meeting one thing that you'll do differently in the next sprint. This must be something that will have a demonstrable, positive impact on how well you complete stories in the next sprint. You will need to reflect on how well you did this and provide evidence so pick something concrete (i.e. not abstract like "work harder") for which it is possible to show evidence. Do not choose communication. While improving this is usually helpful in previous years most groups choose this but then can't provide evidence of improving it._


## Reflection on how successful you were at implementing this change

(100-300 words)

_Reflect on how well you did the thing you said you would. Provide evidence (if you like you can add files into the same folder as this document mention them here). Reflect on whether this had the impact you hoped for. If so, provide evidence._

1. Sprint zero will begin on the 26th on November, and the final Sprint will continue on the 3rd of December. 

2. The Group have decided on created a calculator as this project idea meets the requirements of having functions (add, subtract, divide, times) and being able to test these functions, for instance checking if the variables have numbers inside instead of letters. We believe created a calculator will test our groups ability to apply Scum and source control techniques. We believe the calculator will enable us to write clear user storys and our definition done.

**WORK HERE**

**Intro:**
1. Sprint zero will begin on the 26th on November, and the final Sprint will continue on the 3rd of December. 
2. The Group have decided on created a calculator as this project idea meets the requirements of having functions (add, subtract, divide, times) and being able to test these functions, 
for instance checking if the variables have numbers inside instead of letters. We believe created a calculator will test our groups ability to apply Scum and source control techniques. 
We believe the calculator will enable us to write clear user storys and our definition done. 

**Definition of Done**:

1. Code is written that fully implements the story. A link to the commit(s) in the Github history that added this code are added to comments in the story in Pivotal Tracker.
2. The code is written in a way such that it can be tested easily. This ensures the Junit tests can cover the entire code.
3. Each new function or change to a fund must be tested by a Junit test that passes. A link to the commit(s) that add or change the unit tests.
4. The user interface for the feature is clear and easy to use. The user interface will be reviewed and approved by the group.

We will ensure each of these requirements are completed for each feature at the end of each sprint before the feature is classed as 'done'.
We will provide evidence of this by accepting that a feature is complete on pivotal tracker if all the criteria is complete and by rejecting it if not.

**End of first sprint review**:
Overall we completed our sprint with a working software that fit the groups aims. However, we believe that our group should have made more use of time and planning via Pivotal Tracker and maintained a proper schedual. As a team we all agree that
where we fell short within our sprint was the planning aspect as some members failed to follow pivotal tracker clearly, along with the fact some of the tasks and goals were unclear and not updated on time. In the future we 
will (all members) update pivotal tracker exactly when we are making changes and adding future goals so that the whole group has an idea of the teams progress and where we need to be. Our group decided that our strengths within this 
project were our ability to precisly match our software design with the user storys; the calculator interfance matched the best user storys (Homework example) as the design was clear, easy to nagivate and to use. We also completed
the JUnit tests with everything working precisley as the definition of done listed. In future sprints we will attempt to create more test branches as one of our commits (https://github.com/UOL-CS/co2012-1819-cw2-group-23/commit/f6243c49c6c7ca3e5f346a0e29c4bd096a0e08b9) you can see someone had accidently removed work
from the documents (intro and desc of project) as they did not pull from the most updated file and ended up pushing over someone elses work, this did not go noticed until the final parts of sprint 1.
